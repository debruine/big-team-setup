The author, Lisa DeBruine, will be available to answer questions asynchronously on the workshop Slack during the conference, 22-24 September 2022.\nThis guide is aimed at people wanting to start a big team science group from the grassroots, with little or no financial or administrative support. It will cover how you recruit members, set up governance, communicate with the team, set up and use social media accounts, use tools for collaboration, and set up a website.\nRemember that this is only one perspective. My qualifications for giving advice are being a founding member and current Associate Director of the Psychological Science Accelerator and the founder of ManyFaces, and having previously been the web and communications officer for the Human Behavior and Evolution Society and the European Human Behaviour and Evolution Association. I’ve had the enormous privileges of being a first-language English speaker at a supportive, well-funded, research intensive university in Scotland. I hope that this guide can be the start of a more extensive guide with more voices and perspectives."

This is a better way to collect and organise ideas than forum posts.\n\nManyFace brainstorming\nCode Review Guide brainstorming\n\nGoogle Docs are an ideal place to start a brainstorming document. Just set up a document and make sure to update the Sharing settings so anyone with the link can edit (or at least comment).\n\n\n1.2.1 Structure\nI would structure the brainstorming document with headers (actually use the heading styles so you can have a navigable outline) like this:\n\nPurpose: explain the purpose of the document and how to use it\nAnnouncements: reserve a space at the top for making announcements or adding tasks\nCore Values: what are the values that bring this group together?\nContributors: introduce yourself, what you bring to the group, and what you hope to get out of it\nResources: what do potential members have to contribute in terms of time, expertise, equipment, or materials?\nQuestions/Goals: what are the questions this group will tackle, or overarching goals?\nIdeas: list all of your ideas for what the group could do; no idea is too big/small yet\nChallenges: what roadblocks do people see to getting this group up and running?\nOrganising: list what needs to be done to get the group started (the rest of this guide should help with that)\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Core Values\nA list of core values can help make sure that people who join the group have aligned goals and values. You can get this started using the examples below and ask the group to help flesh them out.\n\nManyFaces Core Values\n\nEthics\n\nPersonal data protection\nAvoiding and speaking out against inappropriate use of AI/face recognition\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity of region, career stage, discipline, methodology, gender, nationality, etc.\nDon’t just make “the rich get richer”\nLabs with more resources have a responsibility to help labs and individual researchers with fewer resources\n\nTransparency\n\nResources and outputs shared as openly as ethics allows\nWhile not every member can be involved in every decision, the process of decision making should be available to all.\n\n\n\n\nManyBabies Principles\n\nTransparency: All decisions in a MB project, from design to publication, are as transparent as possible\nCollective governance: When possible and feasible, decisions are made jointly and transparently\nInclusivity and diversity: MB explicitly encourages efforts to increase diversity. This includes active applications for funding to assist laboratories from under-represented communities to participate, outreach efforts, and planning workshops\nEthical research: MB projects are committed to best practices and high ethical standards\nRespect: Everyone agrees to a general code of conduct which ensures respectful interactions\n\n\n\nPSA Core Principles\n\nDiversity and inclusion\nDecentralized authority\nTransparency\nRigor\nOpenness to criticism\n\nSee the PSA website for more details."

    "text": "2.3 Track Membership\nHow will you keep track of members? A new organisation probably won’t be collecting dues, but you’ll want some way to know who is involved. Inevitably, you’ll want to write “We have XXX members from XX countries around the world!” or make a map of your membership, so you need a way to keep track.\nThe interest registration form Section 1.1 can serve as the initial membership list, but you probably want more information from the members, such as their areas of expertise, resources they can contribute, and tasks they are willing to take on.\nThink about how you’ll keep track of active versus inactive members. You can make membership forever (at least until a removal request). The main advantage of this strategy is that your membership numbers will only increase. However, you’ll have to deal with more bounced emails every year and it is difficult to know who is active for planning and capacity purposes. Alternatively, you can make membership for a set amount of time, like a year, and require members to re-join every year. This can give you a more accurate view of your membership, but risks losing people who just forgot to re-join and is an extra yearly hassle for everyone."

ManyFaces currently has a much less formal process where work projects are proposed in a discussion channel and, once the proposer deems there is enough interest, a working group is formed."

    "text": "3.2 Discussions\nYour group will have a lot of things to discuss, and need a forum to do this with. Some things to consider when choosing a platform:\n\nIs the platform accessible to all members?\nWhat are the limits in terms of members, messages, time , channels, archiving?\nIs the service free and likely to remain so as your team grows?\nDoes the platform provide enough channels and threading for the complexity of your projects?\nDoes the service integrate with other tools you might want to use (e.g., Google Drive, calendars)\nDo you need integrated video chat? Most academics have access to institutional Zoom, so can use that for virtual meetings.\n\nSlack used to be the go-to platform for bog team science discussion. It was easy to set up a free group and get people to join. However, with the recent introduction of a 90-day limit on viewing past posts for the free version, I cannot recommend it any more. The academic discount is 85%, but that’s still $0.78 (US) per active user per month, which makes it hard for big, active teams to afford.\n\nDiscord has a lot of the same features and a similar user interface to Slack, without the 90-day limit. It also has a voice chat feature.\nMattermost is an open-source Slack clone, but I haven’t tried it.\n\nBasecamp is a project management app that I’ve heard good things about, but haven’t tried. It’s only free up to 20 users, and $99/month after that for any size team, so probably not a first choice for a new team.\nMicrosoft Teams can seem like a good alternative if your university already makes you use it, but signing onto a new organisation can be tricky and the desktop app is a disaster for many.\nGitHub Discussions can be a good solution if your group has a coding focus already and most members have or would not object to getting a github account (see Section 4.5). Despite being the go-to repository for open-source software, GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so that may affect your opinion. The Code Check Club is currently using github discussions for announcements (members can opt into an email digest), but actual discussion has really waned since we moved off Slack.\nCanvas is normally used for managing teaching, but the brilliant Erin Buchanan has repurposed this open-source software for the PSA Member site. It’s not something I’d recommend for a new group, but something to think about as you grow. It can be an all-in-one solution for tracking membership, email announcements, and project management."

    "text": "3.3 Social Media\nNow that you’ve set up the main channel of communication with your team, you may wish to use social media to advertise what you’re up to and continue recruitment. The main things you need to consider before setting up social media accounts are:\n\nWho is your target audience? Existing members, potential new members, academics, the public?\nWhat social media do they use?\nAre there sections of your audience that can’t access some social media? For example, Twitter is inaccessible to many Chinese academics.\nWhat names are available?\n\nThis last one might seem silly, but it’s annoying and confusing to have different names across different platforms because your preferred name wasn’t available on one. Choose a name that is likely to be available on all social media you’ll use, as well as the platforms in Chapter 4, such as Google or GitHub.\nI’d recommend setting up an account at all of the major social media platforms, even if you don’t intend on using it much, just to make sure no one else can misrepresent your organisation by taking that name. Just set up the general information and link to your main source of information (e.g., Twitter or a webpage).\nYou can set up most of these account using your group’s Google profile, which is a good way to avoid having too many login details to remember. However, you may also want to sign up for a group password manager, such as 1Password.\n\nTwitter is good for sharing announcements\nFacebook Groups are good for discussions and community engagement\nInstagram is good for sharing images\nTikTok is good for sharing short videos (up to 10 minutes) with an engaging style\nYouTube is good for sharing longer videos and curating playlists"
